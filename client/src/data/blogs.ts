At <strong id=>Greenfoot Energy Solutions</strong>, we believe energy efficiency starts with small changes that lead to long-term savings. Here’s our updated guide for 2025 — practical, affordable tips that make a real difference in your home’s comfort and efficiency.</p><h2 id=><strong id=>1. Upgrade to Energy-Efficient Heating and Cooling</strong></h2><p id=>Heating and cooling account for nearly 60% of a home’s energy use. Upgrading to a <strong id=>cold-climate heat pump</strong> can dramatically lower costs while keeping your home comfortable year-round. Modern mini-split systems can reduce heating bills by up to 50% and provide efficient air conditioning in summer — all from one system.</p><p id=><strong id=>Pro Tip:</strong> Check for <strong id=>provincial and federal rebates</strong> before you upgrade. Greenfoot can help you navigate available incentives in your region.</p><h2 id=><strong id=>2. Improve Your Home’s Insulation</strong></h2><p id=>Insulation is your first defense against energy loss. Properly insulating attics, walls, and basements helps your heating and cooling systems work more efficiently, reducing monthly bills and improving comfort.</p><p id=><strong id=>Quick Wins:</strong></p><ul id=><li id=>Add weatherstripping around doors and windows.</li><li id=>Seal cracks with caulking or expanding foam.</li><li id=>Upgrade attic insulation to meet current R-value standards.</li></ul><p id=>These small steps can reduce heat loss by up to 25%.</p><h2 id=><strong id=>3. Use Smart Thermostats for Better Control</strong></h2><p id=>Smart thermostats learn your habits and automatically adjust temperatures for comfort and savings. You can control them from your smartphone, set schedules, and track energy use in real time.</p><p id=><strong id=>Bonus:</strong> Many models integrate seamlessly with heat pumps and can lower annual energy use by 10–15%.</p><h2 id=><strong id=>4. Maintain Your Heat Pump System</strong></h2><p id=>A well-maintained system runs more efficiently and lasts longer. Schedule annual tune-ups with certified technicians to clean filters, check refrigerant levels, and test system performance.</p><p id=><strong id=>Regular maintenance means:</strong></p><ul id=><li id=>Lower energy bills</li><li id=>Better air quality</li><li id=>Fewer unexpected repairs</li></ul><p id=>If you rent through a program like <strong id=>Saint John Energy’s Heat Pump Rental Program</strong>, Greenfoot handles these services at no extra cost.</p><h2 id=><strong id=>5. Switch to LED Lighting</strong></h2><p id=>Lighting accounts for up to 15% of household electricity. Replacing old bulbs with <strong id=>LED lights</strong> can cut that in half — while offering longer lifespan and better light quality. Consider dimmers and motion sensors for added savings.</p><h2 id=><strong id=>6. Choose ENERGY STAR® Appliances</strong></h2><p id=>When it’s time to replace old appliances, look for the <strong id=>ENERGY STAR®</strong> label. These models meet strict efficiency standards set by the U.S. and Canadian governments. Upgrading your washer, dryer, or refrigerator can save hundreds of dollars each year while reducing your home’s carbon footprint.</p><h2 id=><strong id=>7. Reduce Phantom Power Use</strong></h2><p id=>Electronics still draw power even when turned off. Use power strips or smart plugs to completely cut power to devices like TVs, gaming consoles, and chargers when not in use. This can reduce total home energy consumption by up to 10%.</p><h2 id=><strong id=>8. Take Advantage of Natural Light and Ventilation</strong></h2><p id=>Open blinds during the day to let in sunlight and warmth. Use ceiling fans to circulate air instead of cranking up the thermostat. In warmer months, close blinds during peak hours to keep cool air in.</p><h2 id=><strong id=>9. Explore Renewable Options</strong></h2><p id=>If you’re ready to go further, consider <strong id=>solar panels</strong> or <strong id=>solar-ready systems</strong>. The technology is now more affordable, and Greenfoot can help you stack federal and provincial rebates to maximize your return.</p><h2 id=><strong id=>10. Partner with Greenfoot Energy Solutions</strong></h2><p id=>Our certified energy experts help homeowners across Atlantic Canada and British Columbia save money through smart upgrades, efficient systems, and rebate guidance. Whether it’s a new installation, maintenance service, or full home assessment, we make energy efficiency simple and stress-free.</p><h3 id=><strong id=>Start Saving Today</strong></h3><p id=>Small changes can make a big impact.

In this step, we always start by looking at our insulation values and how much natural air leakage we have in our home or business. The first step to any project is INSULATION and AIR SEALING.</p><p id=>It's SIMPLE: Would you go outside in the winter without a coat on? Well your house is the same way. Keeping the heat in the house not only saves you money, it also makes your home more comfortable.</p><p id=>By making sure your house has adequate levels of insulation, it will also reduce your required heating system size therefore indirectly saving you MONEY!</p><h3 id=><strong id=>STEP # 2</strong></h3><p id=>Once you have gone through the design process and you have determine with a Energy Advisor that your levels of insulation and air leakage levels are adequate, we then move forward to sizing your system. According to the Canadian Geo-exchange Coalition and also based on the CSA standard C-448, it is recommend you size your system based on 70% of the required design heat load you would have received in step 1. This means that if your region has a design temperature standard of -23 C, and you need 48,000 btu/hr to keep your home to +22 C, you would size your system to <strong id=>33,600</strong> btu/hr (48,000 x 0.7). Based on this number, you then chose your proper heating equipment and design your ductwork according to this system.</p><p id=>If this is a retrofit, you would make sure your ductwork can accommodate for this new system as heat pumps generally require much more CFM's than other systems.</p><p id=>As a general rule, we recommend forced air applications compared to hydronic in-floor heating systems because of the cost difference and also the reduced efficiency with the Hydronics.</p><figure id= class=w-richtext-figure-type-image w-richtext-align-floatleft data-rt-type=image data-rt-align=floatleft data-rt-max-width=><div id=><img src=https://cdn.prod.website-files.com/68874c9990cff00613a8654a/68874c9990cff00613a86a8b_607e17cd19b2117cc3e61b2a_14380123_868935799909169_2206855694222764147_o.jpeg width=auto height=auto alt= loading=auto id=></div><figcaption id=>Ductwork Installation for geothermal</figcaption></figure><p id=>‍</p><h3 id=><strong id=>STEP # 3</strong></h3><p id=>Now that you know which size of system you need, ductwork requirements and configuration, your next step is to determine which type of heat sync (energy source) to choose from and how this will affect your system.</p><p id=>The first choice is between OPEN LOOP or CLOSED LOOP.</p><p id=><em id=>Here is the difference:</em></p><p id=><strong id=>Open Loop:</strong> This system basically consists of a open water well (same as a regular drinking well) where you pump water out of the water table, extract the energy (heat) out of it on the indoor coil and dump it back into the same water table down flow. This system provides you with more efficiency but requires more maintenance on the system because of mineral deposit buildup on your system. Long term, your well might dry up making this solution a risky one.</p><p id=><strong id=>Closed Loop:</strong> This system consists of drilling a 4 to 6 vertical hole, dropping down a continuous piping loop of 1 to 1.25 between 150' to 500' deep. The hole is then filled with a highly conductive grout product know as bentonite and sealed. This configuration does not rely on water as it absorbs energy directly from the ground where you have constant warm temperatures. You can also install horizontal loops AKA slinky's and this option will require extensive landscaping and digging.</p><h3 id=><strong id=>STEP # 4</strong></h3><p id=>Comparing quotes for Geothermal can be confusing as not every Geothermal installer does it the same way. Some installers use 150' vertical bore holes with 3/4 piping and install exterior header manifolds. Some of them go 300' deep vertically and install 1 pipe and install indoor manifolds and some others drill 500' deep and use 1.25 pipe. Bottom line, there are many configurations that can be used with drilling or trenching and each one of them affects the system whether it is having more pumping power needed because of certain pipe sizes and dept, as long as the loop field is designed with proper software tools that are mostly supplied by brand manufacturers. The main thing you need to compare is total dept of drilling compared to the others. Some contracts double their pipes in a bigger hole and expect the system to absorb 2x the amount of energy in the ground where in fact it would not. Make sure to know the total footage when you compare.</p><figure id= class=w-richtext-figure-type-image w-richtext-align-fullwidth data-rt-type=image data-rt-align=fullwidth data-rt-max-width=><div id=><img src=https://cdn.prod.website-files.com/68874c9990cff00613a8654a/68874c9990cff00613a86a8d_607e17cd19b211320ae61b27_13116070_786973594772057_5145922019881161815_o.jpeg width=auto height=auto alt= loading=auto id=></div><figcaption id=>Greenfoot Energy Geothermal Drilling Rig</figcaption></figure><h3 id=><strong id=>STEP # 5</strong></h3><p id=>At this step, you will compare system heating efficiency. Geothermal systems are tested and given a COP (Coefficient of performance). The best way to understand a COP is to compare electric baseboard heaters. These baseboard heaters have a COP of 1 which means it takes 1 KW of electricity to provide 1 KW of heat. The input is the same as the output which means it is 100% efficient so a COP of 1. Geothermal heating systems have on average a COP of 4 which means 400% efficiency. Spend $1 worth of electricity and get $4 worth of usable heat. <strong id=>Pretty neat right? </strong>It is also VERY important to compare different COP's at the same EWT (Entering water temperature). Typically, most units compare at 32 degrees Fahrenheit or zero (0) degrees Celsius and also finally you need to make sure you are looking at the right ground source.</p><figure id= class=w-richtext-figure-type-image w-richtext-align-center style=max-width:100% data-rt-type=image data-rt-align=center data-rt-max-width=100%><div id=><img src=https://cdn.prod.website-files.com/68874c9990cff00613a8654a/68874c9990cff00613a86a8e_607e17cd19b2110506e61b2c_data.jpeg width=auto height=auto alt= loading=auto id=></div></figure><p id=>In this graphic, notice how you have Water Loop Heat pump, Ground Water Heat pump and Ground Loop Heat pump? Well if you look at the COP's, there is a big difference while comparing. The reason is simple: The EWT (Entering water temperatures) are higher in some categories which means that its energy source is different. Ground loop Heat pumps are for closed loop vertical and horizontal applications. Ground Water Heat pump category is for Open loop systems and Water loop heat pump is mostly for pond applications where it is rarely seen in the industry. What you will also notice is each model # has PSC or ECM attached to them. This refers to the type of blower fan motor in the system. ECM is most common and more efficient. In Step # 2, we determined the heat loss (33,600 btu/hr) and chose a Closed loop vertical system therefore we look at the ground loop heat pump column and find a <strong id=>COP of 3.7</strong> for the <em id=>TS-048 ECM</em> model. Make sure you are comparing the right configuration as you would be surprised to find that some Geothermal installers do not fully understand how to read these charts and make the mistake of taking the brochure efficiency indicated which would most likely be the highest one they can achieve and in this case (5.2 COP).</p><h3 id=><strong id=>CONCLUSION</strong></h3><p id=>If you are thinking of going Geothermal and would like some guidance with choosing the right system and pricing your options, Greenfoot is just a call away. Get in touch with one of our energy advisors than can help you with Steps 1 through 5 and since Greenfoot does central heat pumps and ductless heat pumps as well, you can rest assured that you will receive un-biased advice on which system you should choose for your home or business. Greenfoot has performed over many residential and commercial systems and our certified installers will make sure the system performs to its capabilities. You will be surprised at how little it costs to go GEO.</p><figure id= class=w-richtext-figure-type-image w-richtext-align-normal data-rt-type=image data-rt-align=normal><div id=><img src=https://cdn.prod.website-files.com/68874c9990cff00613a8654a/68874c9990cff00613a86a8f_607e17cd19b2111f5ee61b2d_13147507_786973718105378_3917358194579128236_o.jpeg width=auto height=auto alt= loading=auto id=></div></figure>",

Some installers use 150' vertical bore holes with 3/4 piping and install exterior header manifolds. Some of them go 300' deep vertically and install 1 pipe and install indoor manifolds and some others drill 500' deep and use 1.25 pipe. Bottom line, there are many configurations that can be used with drilling or trenching and each one of them affects the system whether it is having more pumping power needed because of certain pipe sizes and dept, as long as the loop field is designed with proper software tools that are mostly supplied by brand manufacturers. The main thing you need to compare is total dept of drilling compared to the others. Some contracts double their pipes in a bigger hole and expect the system to absorb 2x the amount of energy in the ground where in fact it would not. Make sure to know the total footage when you compare.</p><figure id= class=w-richtext-figure-type-image w-richtext-align-fullwidth data-rt-type=image data-rt-align=fullwidth data-rt-max-width=><div id=><img src=https://cdn.prod.website-files.com/68874c9990cff00613a8654a/68874c9990cff00613a86a8d_607e17cd19b211320ae61b27_13116070_786973594772057_5145922019881161815_o.jpeg width=auto height=auto alt= loading=auto id=></div><figcaption id=>Greenfoot Energy Geothermal Drilling Rig</figcaption></figure><h3 id=><strong id=>STEP # 5</strong></h3><p id=>At this step, you will compare system heating efficiency. Geothermal systems are tested and given a COP (Coefficient of performance). The best way to understand a COP is to compare electric baseboard heaters. These baseboard heaters have a COP of 1 which means it takes 1 KW of electricity to provide 1 KW of heat. The input is the same as the output which means it is 100% efficient so a COP of 1. Geothermal heating systems have on average a COP of 4 which means 400% efficiency. Spend $1 worth of electricity and get $4 worth of usable heat. <strong id=>Pretty neat right? </strong>It is also VERY important to compare different COP's at the same EWT (Entering water temperature). Typically, most units compare at 32 degrees Fahrenheit or zero (0) degrees Celsius and also finally you need to make sure you are looking at the right ground source.</p><figure id= class=w-richtext-figure-type-image w-richtext-align-center style=max-width:100% data-rt-type=image data-rt-align=center data-rt-max-width=100%><div id=><img src=https://cdn.prod.website-files.com/68874c9990cff00613a8654a/68874c9990cff00613a86a8e_607e17cd19b2110506e61b2c_data.jpeg width=auto height=auto alt= loading=auto id=></div></figure><p id=>In this graphic, notice how you have Water Loop Heat pump, Ground Water Heat pump and Ground Loop Heat pump? Well if you look at the COP's, there is a big difference while comparing. The reason is simple: The EWT (Entering water temperatures) are higher in some categories which means that its energy source is different. Ground loop Heat pumps are for closed loop vertical and horizontal applications. Ground Water Heat pump category is for Open loop systems and Water loop heat pump is mostly for pond applications where it is rarely seen in the industry. What you will also notice is each model # has PSC or ECM attached to them. This refers to the type of blower fan motor in the system. ECM is most common and more efficient. In Step # 2, we determined the heat loss (33,600 btu/hr) and chose a Closed loop vertical system therefore we look at the ground loop heat pump column and find a <strong id=>COP of 3.7</strong> for the <em id=>TS-048 ECM</em> model. Make sure you are comparing the right configuration as you would be surprised to find that some Geothermal installers do not fully understand how to read these charts and make the mistake of taking the brochure efficiency indicated which would most likely be the highest one they can achieve and in this case (5.2 COP).</p><h3 id=><strong id=>CONCLUSION</strong></h3><p id=>If you are thinking of going Geothermal and would like some guidance with choosing the right system and pricing your options, Greenfoot is just a call away. Get in touch with one of our energy advisors than can help you with Steps 1 through 5 and since Greenfoot does central heat pumps and ductless heat pumps as well, you can rest assured that you will receive un-biased advice on which system you should choose for your home or business.
