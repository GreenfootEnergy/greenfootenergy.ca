        {
          question: "What is a dual fuel heating system?",
          answer: "A dual fuel heating system combines an electric heat pump with a gas furnace to provide efficient heating year-round. The system automatically switches between the heat pump and furnace based on outdoor temperature, using the most efficient fuel source at any given time to minimize energy costs while maximizing comfort."
        },
        {
          question: "How does a dual fuel system save money on heating bills?",
          answer: "Dual fuel systems save money by using the heat pump when outdoor temperatures are mild (typically above -5°C to 0°C), which is 2-3 times more efficient than gas heating. When temperatures drop below the heat pump's efficient operating range, the system switches to the gas furnace. This intelligent switching ensures you're always using the most cost-effective heating method."
        },
        {
          question: "What temperature does a dual fuel system switch from heat pump to furnace?",
          answer: "The switchover temperature, also called the balance point, is typically set between -5°C and 5°C (23°F to 41°F) depending on your heat pump model, local electricity and gas rates, and personal preference. Modern systems like the Tosot APEX can operate efficiently down to -22°F (-30°C), so your technician will optimize the setting for your specific situation."
        },
        {
          question: "Is a dual fuel system worth it in Canada?",
          answer: "Yes, dual fuel systems are particularly well-suited to Canadian climates. They provide reliable heat even in extreme cold while taking advantage of the heat pump's efficiency during milder weather. Many Canadian homeowners see 20-40% savings on annual heating costs compared to using a furnace alone."
        },
        {
          question: "How long does dual fuel system installation take?",
          answer: "Most dual fuel installations are completed in 1-2 days. This includes removing your old equipment, installing the new heat pump and furnace (if needed), connecting the systems, configuring the smart thermostat, and testing automatic fuel switching. Complex installations may take slightly longer."
        },
        {
          question: "What maintenance does a dual fuel system require?",
          answer: "Dual fuel systems require annual maintenance for both the heat pump and furnace components. This includes cleaning or replacing filters, checking refrigerant levels, inspecting electrical connections, cleaning the outdoor unit, and verifying the switchover controls work properly. We recommend our YETI maintenance plans for comprehensive coverage."
        },
        {
          question: "Can I add a heat pump to my existing furnace?",
          answer: "Yes, in many cases you can add a heat pump to your existing furnace to create a dual fuel system. Our Home Comfort Advisors will assess your current furnace's compatibility, age, and condition to determine if this is the best option or if a complete system replacement would provide better long-term value."
        },
        {
          question: "What brands of dual fuel systems does Greenfoot install?",
          answer: "Greenfoot Energy Solutions installs premium dual fuel systems from Napoleon, American Standard, and Tosot. Each brand offers unique advantages: Napoleon provides precision Canadian engineering, American Standard delivers proven reliability with up to 97% AFUE, and Tosot offers advanced inverter technology for extreme cold performance."

      title: "Frequently Asked Questions About Residential Solar",
      q1: "How much does residential solar cost in Canada?",
      a1: "The average residential solar system in Canada costs between $15,000 and $30,000 before rebates and incentives. After provincial rebates and federal tax credits, your net cost can be significantly lower. We provide free, no-obligation quotes to give you an accurate estimate for your home.",
      q2: "How long do solar panels last?",
      a2: "Quality solar panels are designed to last 25-30 years or more. Most manufacturers offer 25-year performance warranties guaranteeing at least 80% of original output. Your solar investment will continue producing clean energy for decades.",
      q3: "Will solar panels work in Canadian winters?",
      a3: "Yes! Solar panels actually work more efficiently in cold temperatures. While winter days are shorter, panels still generate significant power. Snow typically slides off panels quickly, and the reflection from snow can actually boost production. Our systems are designed for Canadian climates.",
      q4: "What is net metering and how does it work?",
      a4: "Net metering allows you to sell excess solar electricity back to the grid. When your panels produce more power than you use, the surplus flows to the grid and you receive credits on your utility bill. At night or on cloudy days, you draw from the grid using those credits.",
      q5: "Do I need a new roof before installing solar?",
      a5: "If your roof is more than 15 years old, we recommend a roof inspection before solar installation. Solar panels last 25+ years, so it's best to ensure your roof can support them for the long term. We can coordinate with roofing contractors if needed.",
      q6: "How much can I save with solar panels?",
      a6: "Most homeowners save 50-70% on their electricity bills with solar. Your exact savings depend on your energy usage, system size, and local utility rates. We'll provide a detailed savings analysis during your free consultation.",
